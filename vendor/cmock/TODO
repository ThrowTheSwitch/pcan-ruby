TODO:
  - Switch default behavior of verify_mocks to force=true
  - Reconcile differences (if any?) between unit and functional tests for Mock
    (Right now the nature of the tests is not much different - neither uses much isolation)
  - Refactor code within Mock, Expector and Trapper - there's dupe code in there

  DONE 
  | Support expect-and-do behavior
  | unit tests for Mockery::Trapper
