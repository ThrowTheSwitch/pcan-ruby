There are two steps to install the Ruby PCAN extension:

1. Install the ruby gem. The command 'gem install <pcan gem filename>'
   will automatically install the gem to your ruby directory.

2. Place the PCAN_USB.dll file in the appropriate directory.
   Since the installation software that comes with the PCAN device does
   not seem to automatically place the dll in the correct location,
   you can either place it in the Windows\System32 directory or you
   can place it in the same working directory as your Ruby files that
   require the extension. I went ahead and put it in my System32 directory
   so that I wouldn't have to worry so much about the location of the
   library.

   I found the DLL on the PCAN CD in the directory USB\PCAN-Light.
